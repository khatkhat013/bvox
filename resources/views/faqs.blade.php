        <p style="padding: 20px;font-size: 16px;">What are futures<br><br>Options are financial instruments that provide
            users with exposure to the price of an underlying asset while limiting their exposure to downside risk. It
            offers buyers the opportunity to go long (call options) or short (put options) in BTC or
            ETH.<br><br>Newcomers to options contracts can learn about:<br><br>• A put option represents the right (not
            the obligation) to sell an asset at a predetermined price within a certain period of time. This gives you
            "short" exposure, as if the price of the underlying asset had fallen, you retain the right to sell the asset
            at a higher price (called the strike price) and make a profit.<br><br>• A call option represents the
            holder's right (not the obligation) to purchase an asset at a predetermined price within a certain period of
            time. This gives you "long" exposure, as if the underlying asset rises in price, you retain the right to
            purchase the asset at a lower price and make a profit<br><br><br><br>What can be done on the Crypto Ranch
            futures trading platform?<br><br><br>You can perform three main operations on this platform: ·Futures
            trading ·Arbitrage trading ·Mining trading<br><br><br><br>What are the contract trading
            rules?<br><br>Transaction Type<br><br>Transaction types are divided into two directions: long position
            opening (buying) and short position opening (selling):<br><br>Buying long (bullish) means that you believe
            that the current index is likely to rise and hope to buy a certain number of new contracts at the price you
            set or the current market price.<br><br>Short selling (position) means that you believe that the current
            index is likely to fall and hope to sell a certain number of new contracts at a price you set or the current
            market price.<br><br>Ordering method<br><br>Limit order: You need to specify the price and quantity of the
            order yourself<br><br>Market order: You only need to set the order quantity, and the price will be the
            current market price<br><br><br><br>Is it safe?<br><br><br>We work very hard to ensure every aspect of the
            platform. We also conduct professional audits of all smart contracts. From the ground up, we designed the
            Crypto Ranch to be as powerful as possible: from the price prediction mechanism to the liquidation mechanism
            to the underlying smart contracts.<br><br><br><br><br>How can you succeed in digital currency
            trading?<br><br>After investors understand the rules of digital currency trading, they may also want to
            choose to invest, but they also want to truly gain profits during the investment process. First, you should
            do your homework, and you also need to rely on common sense. Many people may not understand this technology
            at all, but you should also know something about virtual currencies. For example, you can pay attention to
            the platform's digital currency exchange. The platform itself will have many virtual currencies, and you can
            learn about the knowledge in between. In addition, in the process of choosing investment, you must choose
            the right time, because it is also very critical in the investment process. Only when the time is ripe can
            we truly achieve our goals and bring more benefits to investors.<br><br>Everyone wants to gain wealth, and
            everyone wants to have a successful career. However, on the road of investment, some people may seem to be
            very happy, but in fact they may have unacceptable sadness, so before you choose to invest. First, we should
            understand the rules of digital currency trading. The digital currency itself can be traded without
            interruption for 24 hours. Therefore, when we make decisions, we must first maintain rationality and
            control. This is also an important content.<br><br><br><br>What are the rules for digital currency
            trading?<br><br>When you understand the rules of digital currency trading, you will find that it is
            relatively simple. The entire digital currency transaction is nothing more than transferring digital
            currency to another user. It is the output of the transaction, etc., then the final difference is equivalent
            to a reward. Generally speaking, do you know what the rules are in between?<br><br>First of all, the trading
            hours are 24 hours a day, all year round, and there is no limit on the rise or fall. You should know that
            there is a 10% limit on the rise and fall of stocks, but there is no limit on virtual currencies. For
            example, on May 28, Bitcoin's single-day increase directly exceeded 20%. In addition, digital currency
            trading rules also include t plus 0 transactions, that is, buying on the same day and selling on the same
            day. Cash can also be withdrawn at any time, and the liquidity of funds is relatively high.<br><br>The rules
            of digital currency trading are actually relatively simple. For example, through basic principles such as
            current price trading and market price trading, you can not only enjoy price priority, but also time
            priority. A higher purchase price will definitely take precedence over a lower purchase price. When the
            order prices are exactly the same, the order can be placed relatively early and the transaction can
            naturally be executed quickly.<br>If your account has not been traded for more than 10 days, the funds will
            be automatically handed over to the system for custody and the corresponding custody fee will be charged
            according to the number of days of custody.<br><br><br>Is it entirely on the blockchain?<br><br>We use a
            hybrid model decentralized exchange with off-chain matching and on-chain settlement. It requires no gas to
            create or cancel orders, but all token transfers are still processed on-chain. This is a more friendly
            structure for market makers and is designed to promote excellent liquidity.<br><br><br><br>Who can use the
            decentralized futures trading platform?<br><br>When our platform first launches, we will be available to
            everyone. There is currently no centralized process for account creation and no planned restrictions on our
            users.<br><br><br><br>What is a credit score?<br><br>Refers to a statistical and evaluation system that
            gives different scores based on participants' trust plans, number of option transactions, financial status
            and other information, and is used to determine whether to approve withdrawals or credit
            lines.<br><br>Credit score:<br><br>580 points-620 points: Maximum weekly withdrawal is $10,000 USD or coin
            equivalent.<br><br>621 points-650 points: Maximum weekly withdrawal is $50,000 USD or coin
            equivalent.<br><br>651 points-680 points: The maximum weekly withdrawal is US$100,000 or its
            equivalent.<br><br>681 points-720 points: The maximum weekly withdrawal is US$500,000 or its
            equivalent.<br><br>721 points: Unlimited withdrawals and above.<br><br>Credit scores can be obtained from
            the bank providing credit or from Crypto Ranch's internal system<br><br></p>
